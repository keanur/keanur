summary: Create a application that provides easy access to 200+ University of Hawaii at Manoa Clubs
---

The University of Hawaii at Manoa ClubConnector is an ongoing project that tries to consolidate all of the university's clubs into one place that makes them easier to find for students. I think clubs are an important part of the college experience so that students can grow and learn more than they would in a lecture hall.

ClubConnector is an app that makes finding clubs, and managing your favorites easy and simple. You can filter through all the clubs that are availabe, and keep up to date with club updates that show up on your profile. A calendar will keep you informed of all the meetings and activites that are going on so you don't have to worry about missing another email with important information.

This project is still in progress, and it is an ongoing challenge to develop. We hope that in the future, our team can fully realize this vision and make finding clubs easier than ever before.

Learn more about the project and see our progress on our [website](https://clubconnector.github.io).
