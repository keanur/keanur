The Mililani High School "Trojan" Marching Band is one of the few marching bands in Hawai'i to compete in the Bands of America (BOA) national competition. From 2014-2015 I was a music and marching technician helping the head director complete tasks and direct students.

During my time there I travelled with the band to football games and local competitions, preping them for performances, and warming up the students before playing. I would also provide sectionals to some of the members who needed it and tutored the kids outside of practice days. The director would often ask for my input on some of the show designs, props, and also uniform changes. 

This project helped me develop more leadership skills and allowed me to understand what does and doesn't work when it comes to tutoring kids and teenagers. When working with such a large body of people (around 100+) you must be stern but also understanding, which means providing dicpline when appropriate while also trying to motivate the people around you; a hard line to balance. The pressures of being in a position like this are high, but the experience can provide insight into managing other groups as well, even in a more professional setting.

You can check out their 2014 show "Uprising" [here](https://youtu.be/4nNnZ9TMYiQ), and their 2015 show "Pandora's Box" [here](https://youtu.be/4RzY2tduelY).
