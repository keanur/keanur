Do you remember the days of MySpace? Friends competing to be in your top 8, ripping music from Limewire in order to "set the mood" for your page? What a time. 

I actually never found myself diving that deep into that world; I was sort of at the end of that wave, and just at the start of the whole Facebook one. I never had a MySpace until much later in the game, but I do remember that people had all sorts of crazy pages. Funky, cluttered, and sometimes downright hideous pages filled the world of MySpace, and most everyone loved it. 

I don't know if this is a popular belief (I'm not going to research it), but I think that MySpace may have contributed to the world of modern, young, hip, web designers. As far as I know, there was no other noteworthy place that actively encouraged you to design a website in such a public way.
