Do you remember the days of MySpace? Friends competing to be in your top 8, ripping music from Limewire in order to "set the mood" for your page? What a time. 

I actually never found myself diving that deep into that world; I was sort of at the end of that wave, and just at the start of the whole Facebook one. I never had a MySpace until much later in the game, but I do remember that people had all sorts of crazy pages. Funky, cluttered, and sometimes downright hideous pages filled the world of MySpace, and most everyone loved it. 

I don't know if this is a popular belief (I'm not going to research it), but I think that MySpace may have contributed to the world of modern, young, hip, web designers. As far as I know, there was no other noteworthy place that actively encouraged you to design a website in such a public way. Back then it was so hard to make your page look good with the tools that you had, it was fun and all, but let's be honest, <i>all of it looked really bad</i>.

Recently, I've been learning more about some UI frameworks and I have to say that I am shocked, <i><b>shocked</b></i>, at how easy it is make make a webpage that looks great with such little effort. I thought that it might be a little more difficult but in all, I have to say, it's just simple.

## A Matter of Semantics 

The framework that I've been looking over the past few weeks is called Semantic UI. To be honest, I was unaware that there were such things as UI frameworks, so I had no idea that this thing even existed. For a little while I just thought that people were really good at working with HTML and CSS because that's all that I knew about, and my experience with that consits only of headaches and heartbreak; everything I did just came out ugly.

What I imagined was that web design consited of people slaving over HTML until their website looked good, or just saying "f*** it all, I'm using Squarespace". 

Turns out (to no one's suprise but my own) that this is in fact <i>not</i> how people do things.

With UI frameworks, like Semantic UI, half of the work is pretty much done for you. There's no need to define crazy classes or insane ```div```s just to put something a menu bar, you pretty much just say what you want, and the framework will give it to you. You want a menu bar? You just write:

```<div class="ui menu">```

And you get just that; a menu bar, and an awesome looking one at that.

I can't imagine how hard that would have been using just HTML and CSS, where would you even begin? 

## Looking Good

I'm not afraid to say that learning about Semantic UI and other UI frameworks is a game changer for me, it really is. I was like most people and believed that web design is stupid hard, but it isn't, at least not really. Sure you have to learn a couple of things about how HTML works and how to format things correctly, but other than that, you're golden.

I feel like more people should be aware of how easy it is to design a website in this time; no longer are we bound to the ugly HTML templates of the MySpace age. Good looking websites are now easier than ever to make and we should strive to go out and make them.

I think that in 2016 there is no reason for people to settle for sub-par looking websites, we have all the tools available to us to make ones that are not only decent, but good looking as well. Welcome to this brave new world, where web design is easier, and pure HTML and MySpace template designs are a thing of the past!

I just wish someone would tell my <a href="http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/">engineering professors that</a>...
