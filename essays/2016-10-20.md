I said in a previous essay that making a good looking website is easy now-a-days, but making a good looking website (or web app) that looks good and works well?

<em>Now that's hard.</em>

I've recently started working with the Meteor web app framework and I have to say, it's kind of blowing my mind. It's like HTML on steroids, and even more. Maybe because I'm such a novice and I'm looking at this whole thing with rose tinted glasses, but I think this whole web design thing is just incredible. There is just so much you can do with the Meteor toolkit, but it is a treacherous world and one that not everyone can make it through.

## Brave New World

To say that there is a learning curve to Meteor would kind of be an understatement and to be quite frank, <em>I don't think Meteor is for everyone.</em> It is a hard thing to learn, and if someone doesn't understand it, I wouldn't blame them for that. I myself don't even understand the very fundamentals, most of the code I did was just sort of a copy and paste job.
