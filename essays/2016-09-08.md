My life as a computer engineering student is filled with questions; simple ones that I ask myself, complex ones that I ask others about, and weirdly specific ones that I would like to ask but never say out loud in order to not sound ridiculous. At this point it would be cliche to say "there's no such thing as a dumb question." Yuck. This is one of the few phrases that I legitametly hate, because I can think of a million different questions that are in fact dumb. Things like "why do meteors always land in craters?" or "why did ancient civilizations build ruins?" are objectivly dumb questions (I've heard both in my college lectures being asked un-ironically). 

But at the same time it would also be cliche to point out this fact without explaining why questions like these are bad. What makes a bad question? What makes a good question? How can we use this to our advantage in our professional lives? Here, I'll be looking at several different questions from StackOverflow in order to determine what makes a question in software engineering worthwhile.

## What Makes This Question Bad?

I find that the best way to learn how to do something is to first observe how not to do it. So lets look at a fairly bad question and dissect it to see what's up.

This is from a user who asks the question "How to find the second biggest mode in C" [(Link)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39401297/how-to-find-the-second-biggest-mode-in-c).
