My life as a computer engineering student is filled with questions; simple ones that I ask myself, complex ones that I ask others about, and weirdly specific ones that I would like to ask but never say out loud in order to not sound ridiculous. At this point it would be cliche to say "there's no such thing as a dumb question." Yuck. This is one of the few phrases that I legitametly hate, because I can think of a million different questions that are in fact dumb. Things like "why do meteors always land in craters?" or "why did ancient civilizations build ruins?" are objectivly dumb questions (I've heard both in my college lectures being asked un-ironically). 

But at the same time it would also be cliche to point out this fact without explaining why questions like these are bad. What makes a bad question? What makes a good question? How can we use this to our advantage in our professional lives? Here, I'll be looking at several different questions from StackOverflow in order to determine what makes a question in software engineering worthwhile.

## What Makes This Question Bad?

I find that the best way to learn how to do something is to first observe how not to do it. So lets look at a fairly bad question and dissect it to see what's up.

This is from a user who asks the question "How to find the second biggest mode in C" [(Link)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39401297/how-to-find-the-second-biggest-mode-in-c).

<blockquote>
<p>
The output on the standard output the number that occurs with the second highest frequency in the input followed by a new line character. If there are more than one such number, your program should output the highest one. If all numbers in the input file have the same frequency then output 0.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the input file contains the integers 1, 2, 10, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2 then frequency of 1 in the input file is 3, frequency of 2 is also 3 and frequencies of 10 and 3 is 1 each. Your program should output 10\n in this case.
</p>

<p>
I finished the sort part , find frequency part, but I do not know how to find the second biggest mode. I attached my find frequency and find second biggest mode code.
</p>
</blockquote>

I didn't put in the code that they also included because from this point already I would have already stopped reading and moved onto the next question.

But <i>why?</i>

There are a few gut reactions that I get from this question, but the biggest one comes from the fact that this question seems to come from some sort of homework problem that the author did not intend on finishing.
