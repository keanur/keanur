I always describe programming the same way to everyone who asks: it's like teaching the dumbest person you can imagine the step by step on how to walk. Computers will follow you without fault; if you tell them to run themselves into the ground, they will try and find a way to damn well do so. You have to be careful in what you say, and how you say it. Be specific enough to understand, but concise enough to be efficient.

It's hard, it's tedious, but it is possible.

This was the challenge when I first learned C; taking a task that seems easy to do, breaking it down into its most basic pieces, and then reassembling those pieces into a set of instructions that a computer can understand. It took a different type of thinking than I was normally used to and through the course of a semester (plus a little more), I learned enough to call myself <i>adequate</i>. Not good, not great, just adequate. Now I find myself trying to learn how to program in Javascript, a language that is similar to what I'm used to, but just different enough to warrent a couple of days worth to actually figure it out.

So, how did I do?

###From C to Javascript
Remember how I said that programming was like trying to teach the dumbest person you know how to walk? That's how I felt about C, and Javascript isn't all that much different, execpt the person isn't as dumb this time around.
