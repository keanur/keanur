I always describe programming the same way to everyone who asks: it's like teaching the dumbest person you can imagine the step by step on how to walk.

You have to be careful in what you say, and how you say it. Be specific enough to understand, but concise enough to be efficient.

It's hard, it's tedious, but it is possible.
