I'm always surprised at how ignorant I can be sometimes. I always discover that there is this world that I don't know about or some community that I never knew existed. 

When it comes to the world of software engineering, I'm actually relatively new, so I don't really know all that much about configuration management. In fact, I didn't even know that this was a thing at all. I mean I've heard about Github and git, but I never really understood what that was or what it did. All I knew was that it was some place where I could download some obscure Eagle library for my engineering projects but nothing outside of that at all.
