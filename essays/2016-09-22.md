I'm sort of a naive programmer; even though I have a couple of years under my belt coding in C and C++, at the end of the day <i>I still kind of suck</i>. Am I getting better? I'd like to think that I am, otherwise I really should have jumped this "Computer Engineering" ship two years ago or so. 

But in the process of learning how to code, I think one of the most important lessons that I've come across is the idea of readability. It's a simple one, and one that I think that most people think about when they code, but still an idea that warrents talking about. Readability and the coding standards that make readablility possible are, in my opinion, one of the most important concepts when encouraging young programmers to learn how to code.

## Leaping Past the Learning Curve

Here's a little story about my journey through the Computer Engineering program: Before I started college, I had aboslutely no programming experience. Like, none at all. I had no idea about counters, loops, if statements, and anything else. 

Then I took my first programming class, which was in C, and let me tell you, I had aboslutely no idea what was going on at all.
